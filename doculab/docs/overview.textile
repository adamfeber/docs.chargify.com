Chargify is a web service that manages the recurring billing for your subscription-based business.

Integration with Chargify for your app, service, or website consists of *4 main phases*:


h3. 1. Define your Products

Using Chargify, you will sell *Subscriptions* to your *Products*.  So to get started, you'll need to tell us what you sell. "Products Intro":/products-intro and "Product Pricing":/product-pricing describes creating your Products and giving them a name, price, recurring interval, available options and components, and more.  Before or after defining your Products, you'll also need to "configure your Site":/sites.


h3. 2. Sell Subscriptions

Once Chargify knows what it is you offer, you’ll be able to sell subscriptions to those products. There are two main ways to sell subscriptions:

# On the Chargify website using your subdomain (i.e. http://acme.chargify.com) and our ""Hosted Payment Pages"":/selling-via-hosted-payment-pages (i.e. we host them for you). When selling with hosted pages, you would provide links to these payment pages from your website.
# On your own website, by talking to "Chargify via our API":/selling-via-api.

Before going live, make sure you've reviewed the information in the support article on "Basic Payment Gateway Requirements":http://support.chargify.com/faqs/getting-started/payment-gateway-requirements.


h3. 3. Recurring Subscription lifecycle

Chargify manages the "recurring lifecycle of your subscriptions":/subscription-states. According to the recurring periods you define, Chargify handles the collection of payments from your customers via the credit cards they gave during sign up.

We also handle (when you so choose) the notifications of card declines and the "Dunning process":/dunning to make sure you keep getting paid. These features are optional, and could also be handled by your app given the information Chargify provides.

At any time, you can get detailed information about your subscriptions, either via our "admin UI":/viewing-and-filtering-subscriptions or "our API":/api-subscriptions.


h3. 4. Managing access to your app or service

Most likely, you’ll need to control access to your own app depending on whether or not someone’s subscription is active. Chargify communicates with you via "Post-backs":/post-backs, where we alert you to changes in subscriptions so that you may fetch the latest data and take appropriate action.

Additionally, full subscription information is always available "via the API":/api-subscriptions so that you may perform maintenance or actions within your own system.
