For "live" subscriptions (i.e. subscriptions that are not @canceled@ or @expired@) you can execute an immediate, one-time (or "one-off") charge of any amount. This just charges the customer's card instantly for the amount you define.

To assess a One-time Charge, navigate to the subscription detail page by clicking on the "Start Date" or on the "View" link in the Subscriptions listing. There, you will see a link to "Add a Charge".

<!-- TODO: screenshot -->

A charge is created by selecting an amount (i.e. "10.00") and a memo (i.e. "Additional charge for extra usage").

The charge will initiate a payment to be collected from the credit card on file for the subscription. If the payment is denied, you will receive a message stating that the card was declined (or that some other error occurred at the payment gateway).

NOTE: Using this feature is like swiping the Customer's credit card - even if your customer has a negative balance (i.e. a credit) at the time you run the charge, using this feature will still capture the payment from the credit card on file.  Options will be added in the future that allow you to alter this behavior, but this will always be the default.
