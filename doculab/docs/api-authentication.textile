The API Authentication is implemented as HTTP Basic Authentication over SSL (HTTPS).  *Your API login credentials are not the same as the credentials you use to log in to the web interface*.  You must obtain your API credentials separately.


h3. Obtaining Your API Credentials

Your API key can be generated from the "API Access" tab of your seller dashboard.

Your http username is your "API Key".

Your "password" is always the letter "x".


h3. Authenticating with your API Credentials

You will use HTTP Basic Authentication to verify your identify via the API.  All requests must come over SSL/HTTPS, and be to the subdomain of the Site you wish to access.  For example, if your Site's subdomain is @acme@, then you would access the Customer resource at:

<pre>
  <code>https://acme.chargify.com/customers.json</code>
</pre>

h4. An example using authentication via curl:

<pre>
  <code>curl -u api-key:x https://subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml</code>
</pre>

or

<pre>
  <code>curl -i https://<api-key>:x@subdomain.chargify.com/customers.xml</code>
</pre>
