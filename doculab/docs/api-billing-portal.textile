If your customer has been invited to the Billing Portal, then they will receive a link to manage their subscription (the "Management URL") automatically at the bottom of their statements, invoices, and receipts.  _This link changes periodically for security and is only valid for 65 days_.  Please be sure to read more about "the links your customers receive for the Billing Portal":/billing-portal

If you need to provide your customer their Management URL through other means, you can retrieve it via the API.  Because the URL is cryptographically signed with a timestamp, it is not possible for merchants to generate the URL without requesting it from Chargify.

In order to prevent abuse & overuse, we ask that you request a new URL only when absolutely necessary.  Management URLs are good for 65 days, so you should re-use a previously generated one as much as possible.  If you use the URL frequently (such as to display on your website), please **do not** make an API request to Chargify every time.  

h2. Rules for Management Link API

* When retrieving a management URL, multiple requests for the same customer in a short period will return the **same** URL
* We will not generate a new URL for 15 days
* You **must** cache and remember this URL if you are going to need it again within 15 days
* Only request a new URL after the @new_link_available_at@ date
* You are limited to 15 requests for the same URL.  If you make more than 15 requests before @new_link_available_at@, you will be blocked from further Management URL requests (with a response code @429@)


h2. Management Link Attributes

All of the attribute fields are returned from GET (read) operations, and all are read only.

* @url@ The customer's management URL
* @fetch_count@ Number of times this link has been retrieved (at 15 you will be blocked)
* @created_at@ When this link was created
* @new_link_available_at@ When a new link will be available and @fetch_count@ is reset (15 days from when it was created)
* @expires_at@ When this link expires (65 days from when it was created)
