After you've configured your payment gateway and verified your Site settings (as described in the section "Settings":/settings), you're ready to start selling.

You have two options:

# Use our hosted payment pages
# Integrate your own app to Chargify via our API

h3. Hosted payment pages

This is the quickest and easiest option to start selling.  Each of your configured Products displays a link for its "Payment Page".

You can place these links on your own website to direct your potential customers to a page where they can pay for your Product and initiate a Subscription.  After their successful purchase, the Customer is shown either a receipt page (hosted by Chargify) or redirected to a page that you specify within the "Return URL" of your "Product Options":/product-options.


h3. API Integration

You can keep the purchase flow within your own website by integrating via our API.  The "API Integration":/api-integration documentation goes in to more depth on this subject but, at a high level, the flow is:

# Customer enters payment information in a form on your own site
# You pass the customer data, payment data, and product identifier to Chargify via a Subscription creation action on our API
# We return a response with a success/fail indication as well as any further data needed for you to render the correct response page to your user


h3. A note on testing

Please, please, please test your integration before going live.  Whether you are using the hosted payment pages or our API, you need to verify your setup through real usage, both so you'll know that your configuration options are correct, and so you'll know more about what your customers will experience.

Chargify sites that are in test mode will work with both the "Chargify Test Gateway" and with the test gateways provided by providers like Authorize.Net, PaymentExpress, Beanstream, etc.  Note that all of the major gateway providers will give you a free test or "developer's" account so that you can test your integration.

When you're ready to go live, you can use the "Clear site data" link at the top of the web UI to clear all of your test data.  You may choose to keep your product set up at this time.

*When your site has no active subscriptions, you may change it in and out of test mode.*  So, once you clear your subscriptions, you can move your site to live mode and change your gateway credentials to those for your production payment gateway.

It is our recommendation to also run a handful of tests against your live gateway.  This testing can reveal misconfigurations in your gateway settings for things like AVS (Address Verification Service) and other fraud filter checks.  *You can always void these transactions later* through your payment gateway interface.  It is worth the few cents in transaction fees you will incur to verify your setup before your Customers attempt to use it.
