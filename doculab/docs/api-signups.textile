h2. Signup Request

h3. Via Chargify Direct

There are two ways to create a new signup via the Chargify API v2. The first is via "Chargify Direct":/chargify-direct-introduction. If you are going to use this method you must be sure to include "secure parameters":/chargify-direct-introduction#secure-parameters in your request. Below is an example of a form that could be used to create a new signup via Chargify Direct.

h4. Chargify Direct Example Request

URL: @https://api.chargify.com/api/v2.1/signups@
Method: @POST@

<script src="http://gist.github.com/8d9ed3261405b94b0e1f.js?file=sample-html-form.html"></script>

h3. Via JSON

New signups can also be created by sending JSON to the same endpoint. If you are going to use this method, you must set the @Content-Type@ header of your HTTP @POST@ request to @application/json@, otherwise the request will be processed as a Chargify Direct request.

h4. JSON Example Request

URL: @https://api.chargify.com/api/v2.1/signups@
Method: @POST@
Content-Type: @application/json@

<script src="http://gist.github.com/8d9ed3261405b94b0e1f.js?file=signup-request.json"></script>

h2. Signup Response

h3. Chargify Direct

See "Chargify Direct Response Parameters":/chargify-direct-introduction#response-parameters for details on Chargify Direct responses.

h3. JSON

The following is an example of a successful JSON @POST@ to @/signups@:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/8d9ed3261405b94b0e1f.js?file=signup-response.json"></script>

h4. Unsuccessful responses

Any errors will be returned within the @meta[errors]@ and @result[errors]@ objects. For example, when trying to create a new subscription without passing in the @payment_profile[expiration_month]@, the following is returned:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/8d9ed3261405b94b0e1f.js?file=signup-response-errors.json"></script>

Not passing in a @customer@ at all will yield the following response:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/8d9ed3261405b94b0e1f.js?file=signup-response-customer.json"></script>
