Dunning is the process of how you handle past due accounts.  It involves communicating with your customers in response to failed credit card transactions. Chargify gives you the ability to customize these communications.

h2. Selecting your dunning plan

Chargify can send your customers dunning emails on your behalf if you check the appropriate box within the "Dunning Plans" section of the "Settings" page.  These emails will be sent according to the dunning plan you select.

Unless you customize your dunning notifications (see below), these emails will include a link to a Chargify-hosted page that allows the customer to update the card on file.

p(warning). Even if you do not want Chargify to manage your dunning, *you'll still need to select your dunning plan to control automatic cancellation*.

Currently, even if you haven't configured Chargify to send dunning emails on your behalf, we will still respect the "Cancel" action initiated by your selected dunning settings.  In other words, if the dunning plan selected automatically cancels a Subscription 21 days after it transitions to @past_due@ state, we will set the Subscription to @canceled@ state.  So, if you want to manage dunning yourself, you should select the "Never Cancel" strategy and uncheck the appropriate box that instructs us to send emails on your behalf.  Then, you'll want to key off of the @past_due@ state within your own app as to when to start dunning.  If you cancel the subscription yourself, the dunning process will discontinue.

To begin customizing your dunning notification, click on the 'Notifications' tab at the top of the page and then click on the 'Dunning emails' tab on the left.

You can edit the subject and body of the email for each day in your dunning strategy. In addition to the text you specify, you can also include keywords that Chargify will replace dynamically before sending the email. Custom parameters look like this:  {{custom_parameter}}. For a full list of custom parameters see the right hand column of the notifications page.
