*Products are the things that you sell*.  Once you create and configure a product, then it becomes available to your Customers.

Customers gain access to your Products by purchasing "Subscriptions":/subscrition-intro to those Products.

In your app or business, you might call these "Plans" or "Feature Levels".  For example, if you have "Basic", "Pro", and "Max" plans, each of these would be a separate Product within Chargify.

h3. Product Families

Products belong to a "*Product Family*":/product-families.  Product Families should contain the Products that are all different "feature levels" of the same thing - i.e. you can usually upgrade and downgrade between Products within the same Product Family.  The "Product Family documentation":/product-families goes in to more depth on how to structure your Product Family and Product relationships.

h3. Creating a Product

Once you have created a Product Family, you will have access to the "Create a Product" link next to the Product Family name.
