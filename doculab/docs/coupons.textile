Chargify allows you to create one-time coupons to give customers a discount on signup. After the initial coupon is applied, customers will be charged the normal amount at the next assessment. 

h3. Creating a Coupon

Coupons are added to the Product Family from the Products tab. Once a coupon has been created it can be shared across all products in the family. To create a new Coupon click the "Create Coupon" link.

A Coupon consists of 5 pieces of information:

* **Name**: A name for the coupon. The name is not displayed to customers
* **Coupon Code**: The code that customers will enter to redeem the coupon. The code must be uppercase letters, numbers and underscores with no spaces
* **Description**: A description of the coupon that can be displayed to customers
* **Amount**: The amount that will be discounted from the initial subscription
* **Percentage**: The percent of the product's base price that will be discounted
* **Expiration Date**: Coupons will no longer be redeemable after this time

Once you have created a Coupon, it will appear under the Product Family on the Products tab. You can make changes to the component by clicking the 'Edit Coupon' link.


h3. Amount vs. Percentage Coupons

Chargify allows you to create two types of coupons: Amount Coupons and Percentage Coupons. An Amount Coupon will give the customer a flat dollar amount discount. A Percentage Coupon will give the customer a discount equal to a specified percentage of the Product's base price. To create a coupon for an exact dollar amount, specify the the value in the Amount field below. To create a coupon that provides a percentage discount on the price of the product, specify the percentage in the Percentage field below. Note: Only one field is required. If both are specified the percentage will be ignored.
