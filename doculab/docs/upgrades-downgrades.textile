h3. Prorated Upgrades and Downgrades

Chargify offers the ability to upgrade or downgrade a Customer's subscription in the middle of a billing period. This action will have the following effects:

* *Prorated credit*: A prorated credit will be created to reimburse the Customer for their current product. Note that this is not a refund; no money will be returned to the user. The credit only effects the Customer's balance.
* *Charge*: A charge for the full amount of the new product will be applied
* *Updated Period Start/End Dates*: The period start date will be reset to today's date

*Note*: The prorated credit is always at least 0.01 currency units (for instance, $0.01). Even if your customer only had a product for a few seconds, proration will result in a minimum charge for that time of 0.01.

To initiate an upgrade or downgrade through the Admin Interface, click the Subscriptions tab and then click the 'Upgrade/Downgrade' link in the Subscription options.

Alternatively, you can click the 'Upgrade/Downgrade' link when viewing a Subscription.

Upon clicking 'Upgrade/Downgrade', you will be able to view the available products, as well as the current product associated with the Subscription. To migrate to another product, press the 'Select Product'.

You will see a success message upon completion of the upgrade or downgrade. Check the Account Transactions tab for a list of the credits/charges that were created.

Upgrades/Downgrades can also be initiated through API; see "API Migrations":/api-migrations

If you'd like to change products without proration, you can use the pre-existing Edit Subscription functionality. Changes made using this method will bypass prorations.
