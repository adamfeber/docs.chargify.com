Components allow you to introduce additional "line items" to your Products that are often expressed as "add-ons", upsold features, or pay-per-use items. See the "blog post about quantity-based components":http://chargify.com/blog/new-feature-quantity-based-components/ that introduces the Components feature in general.

Components are defined at the Product Family level, and are therefore available to all Products within the Family.

We currently support the following types of Components:

* Quantity-based: used when a Subscription is provisioned with a certain quantity of an item, and charges are calculated based on that quantity.  These components also give the ability to use different pricing schemes, such as per-unit, volume, tiered, and stairstep
* Metered-usage: used when a Subscription is assessed an amount based on the quantity used in any given period; the quantity resets to 0 at the beginning of each period
* On/Off Components: used to elect upgrade options where electing the option results in an extra charge

h4. Use-case examples for Quantity-based Components

* A Project Management tool allows you to purchase the ability to manage extra projects at $10 per month per project

h4. Use-case examples for Metered Components

* An email gateway provides 1000 credits per period, but allows you to send over your credit limit at a cost of $0.10 per email per period
* A hosting company charges for hours of compute time at a certain cost per hour

h4. Use-case examples for On/Off Components

* A web app offers an SSL connection upgrade at $5/month

h3. Configuring Components available for Product Families

<!-- TODO: insert a screenshot of defining products -->

Components are added to Product Families from the "Products" tab of a Site.  Creation is fairly self-explanatory with helpful embedded documentation.

NOTE: Configuring components is not currently available from within the API at the time of this writing.

h3. Setting Component allocations on Subscriptions

Once a Component has been defined for a Product Family, any Subscription to a Product within that Family may have usage or allocation data reported in order to assess charges for them at the end of the period.

For more information, please see "Setting Component Allocations":/setting-component-allocations.

NOTE: At the time of this writing, setting Component allocations can only be done from the API.  Unfortunately, this feature is not yet within the UI or Hosted Pages, but it is something we are working towards.
