Components allow you to introduce additional "line items" to your Products that are often expressed as "add-ons", upsold features, or pay-per-use items. See the "blog post about quantity-based components":http://chargify.com/blog/new-feature-quantity-based-components/ that introduces the Components feature in general.

Components are defined at the Product Family level, and are therefore available to all Products within the Family.

p(note). Components that are "used" on a Subscription have their *charges billed at the end of the period* (which coincides with the start of the next period, which is when recurring charges are also billed).  See "Setting Component Allocations":/setting-component-allocations for more.

h2. Types of Components

h3. Quantity-based

This component type would be used when a Subscription is provisioned with a certain quantity of an item, and charges are calculated based on that quantity.  These components also give the ability to use different pricing schemes, such as per-unit, volume, tiered, and stairstep. Some examples:

* A Project Management tool allows you to purchase the ability to manage extra projects at $10 per month per project
* A hosting company that allows you to purchase additional IP addresses at $1 each per month
* Software seats that cost $100/each when you buy 1-5, $90/each when you buy 6-10, etc.

Each "widget" that you've reported to us as being in use is assumed to remain in use by that Customer until some future change.  In other words, the quantity allocated does NOT reset to 0 at the end of the billing period.  In contrast, Metered-usage component usages DO reset to 0 at the end of the period.


h3. Metered-usage

This component type would be used when a Subscription is assessed an amount based on the quantity used in any given period; the quantity resets to 0 at the beginning of each period. Some examples:

* An email gateway provides 1000 credits per period, but allows you to send over your credit limit at a cost of $0.10 per email per period
* A hosting company that charges for hours of compute time at a certain cost per hour

h3. On/Off

This component type is used to elect "add-on" options where electing the option results in an extra charge. Some examples:

* A web app offers an SSL connection upgrade at $5/month


h2. Configuring Components available for Product Families

p(warning). Configuring components is only available from the UI (no in the API) at the time of this writing.

Components are defined on the Product Family level, and are available to all Products within the Family.

To create a Quantity Component for your Chargify Site, start on the "Products" tab and click "Create a Component".

Next, you'll be able to choose what type of component to create.  Choose "Quantity Based Component".

Finally, define your Quantity Component using the form.

Quantity Components support 4 "pricing schemes" via a dropdown select on this form: per-unit, volume, tiered, and stairstep.  The latter 3 schemes (volume, tiered, and stairstep) allow you to define multiple price brackets (or "steps"), so you can charge different amounts depending on the quantity allocated.

h3. General Price Bracket Rules

* No Overlap: Brackets may not overlap in quantity
* No Gaps: Gaps in quantity are not allowed; however the lowest bracket need not start at 1
* *Defining Infinity:* One bracket with a blank "ending quantity" is allowed - a blank value here indicates an unbounded quantity (&infin;)
* Per-Unit or Per-Bracket: Prices should be given as "per unit" for per-unit, tiered, and volume pricing schemes. Prices for the stairstep pricing scheme are given as a cost for the entire bracket.

h3. Per-unit Pricing Scheme

In a per-unit pricing scheme, prices are defined as per-unit costs, and all units cost the same.  Thus, only 1 price bracket may be defined.  If you define a component for "IP Addresses" that cost $1/each/period and a customer buys 3, then a $3 charge would be added at the end of the period.

h3. Tiered Pricing Scheme

In the tiered pricing scheme, multiple price brackets define the prices at different quantity levels.  Prices are given on a per-unit basis.  Your customers will pay the defined price per unit for each allocated unit.  An example can illustrate this the best.  Say you allow your customers to purchase extra widgets to augment their monthly plan.  The pricing structure is defined as follows:


h2. Setting Component allocations on Subscriptions

Once a Component has been defined for a Product Family, any Subscription to a Product within that Family may have usage or allocation data reported in order to assess charges for them at the end of the period.

For more information, please see "Setting Component Allocations":/setting-component-allocations.

p(warning). At the time of this writing, setting Component allocations can only be done from the API.  Unfortunately, this feature is not yet within the UI or Hosted Pages, but it is something we are working towards.
