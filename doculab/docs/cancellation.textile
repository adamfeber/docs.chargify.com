A canceled Subscription is no longer billed by Chargify.  There are two ways a Subscription can be canceled:

# Explicitly requesting cancellation via the UI or API
# After a period of time (defined by your "Dunning":/dunning plan) passes with no payment for an overdue balance

h2. Requesting Cancellation

h3. Via the Admin UI

You can request cancellation of a Subscription yourself by clicking "Cancel Subscription" from the operations menu.

After clicking "Cancel Subscription", you will have the opportunity to enter a message about the cancellation and review the action before pressing the "Cancel Subscription" button.

When you cancel a Subscription:

* The subscription is immediately canceled, and the customer's credit card will no longer be charged
* No refunds or prorations are made
* No email is sent to your Customer

You can later "Reactivate":/reactivation a canceled Subscription.

h3. Via the API

See the "Delete/Cancel method in the Subscriptions API":/api-subscriptions#cancel.


h2. Automatic Cancellation due to Dunning

After a failed payment, Subscriptions transition to the Past Due state within Chargify.  At this point, Chargify begins attempting to re-run the payment on a smart schedule.  Eventually, we cease retrying to re-run the payment, and some of the Dunning strategies will automatically move the Subscription to Canceled state. See the "Dunning documentation":/dunning for how to control this automatic cancelation.
