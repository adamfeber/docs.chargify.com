h3. Subdomains

Your subdomain identifies your site uniquely and is most visible within the Hosted Pages. For example, if your subdomain is acme then your unique Chargify URL would be:

<pre><code>https://acme.chargify.com</code></pre>

h3. Currency

Chargify supports multiple currencies. Each Site may only have one currency. If you need to sell in multiple currencies, you will need to set up a separate Site for each currency.

h3. Test Mode

Every Site may be in one of two modes: test mode or live mode. Test mode is different from live mode in the following ways:

Test mode only allows you to connect to “test” payment gateways (i.e. an Authorize.Net developers account)

You may freely delete products and subscriptions on a Test Site

Test site data may be automatically deleted after a certain time frame
