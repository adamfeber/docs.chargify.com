When you are new to Chargify you have no *Sites*.  Sites are simply "containers" for your Products, Customer, and Subscriptions.  You can get by just fine having just one Site, although most people will want 2 sites at a minimum - one for _testing_ and one for _production_.

h3. Create a new Site

Buttons and links for creating a new site are displayed prominently when you first log in to Chargify.  You can always access the "New Site" page from the toolbar.  There will either be a "Create Site" button there, or there will be a "Create a new Site" link when you hover over the Site dropdown.

h3. Site Data

When you are creating or altering a Site, you will have access to the following Site Data:

h4. Site Name

The _Site Name_ is a name you will use to identify the Site - this name is not shown to your customers.  Good starting names might be "Test" or "Production".

h3. Subdomain

Your subdomain identifies your site uniquely (across all of Chargify) and is most visible within the Hosted Pages. For example, if your subdomain is <code>acme</code> then your unique Chargify URL would be:

<pre><code>https://acme.chargify.com</code></pre>

Your customers _may_ see your subdomain within the URL of your hosted pages if you choose to use them.  Its smart to pick a name that is similar to your domain name.

h3. Currency

Chargify supports multiple currencies. Each Site may only have one currency. If you need to sell in multiple currencies, you will need to set up a separate Site for each currency.

The currency is used in price displays found in the Web UI and on Hosted Pages.  It is also the currency that is used as the "submission currency" to the gateways.  This means that the transactions we submit to your gateway are specified using this currency.  Note that this can be different than the settlement currency of your Merchant Account.

h3. Test Mode

Every Site may be in one of two modes: test mode or live mode. Test mode is different from live mode in the following ways:

* Test mode only allows you to connect to “test” payment gateways (i.e. an Authorize.Net developers account)
* You may freely delete products and subscriptions on a Test Site, using the "Clear Data" functionality
* Chargify reserves the right to delete test site data automatically after a certain time frame (i.e. any subscriptions created more than 3 months ago may be deleted).
