h3. Getting Started

We suggest starting with our "Quick Start Guide", specifically one of the following pages:

* "Chargify Overview":/overview - get quickly oriented to see where Chargify fits in to the big picture
* "Terminology":/terminology - learn the terms we'll use throughout these docs
* "Getting Started":/getting-started - a guide that helps you get up and running

If you're new to the concept of Merchant Accounts and Gateways, you may be interested in our "Basic Payment Gateway Requirements":http://support.chargify.com/faqs/getting-started/payment-gateway-requirements knowledge base article.
