The Web UI is used to:

* Create and configure Sites
* Create and configure Products
* Manage your Subscriptions and Customers

Throughout the documentation, we refer to the User Interface interchangeably as "the UI", "Admin UI", and "Web UI".  Some functions can be performed either via the UI or the API, so where applicable, we make a distinction.
