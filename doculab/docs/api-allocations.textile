Allocations describe a change to the allocated quantity for a particular "Component":/api-components (either "Quantity-Based":/product-components#quantity-based-components or "On/Off":/product-components#on-off-components) for a particular "Subscription":/api-subscriptions.

Working with this resource, you can:

* "List Allocations":#list-allocations : View the history of the allocated quantity for the component over time
* "Create an Allocation":#create-an-allocation :  Set a new allocated quantity for the line-item (as an alternative to setting the allocated quantity directly on the Component Line-Item resource)
